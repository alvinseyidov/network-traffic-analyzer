# Network Traffic Analyzer

A Python-based network traffic analysis tool designed to inspect packet captures and detect suspicious network behavior.

This project focuses on **traffic patterns, anomalies, and detection**, not on exploitation.

---

## What This Project Demonstrates

- Packet-level network analysis
- Understanding TCP/UDP behavior
- DNS traffic inspection
- Detection of suspicious patterns
- Blue Team / SOC thinking

---

## Security Topics Covered

- Packet structure and headers
- DNS tunneling indicators
- Abnormal port usage
- Long-lived connections
- Repeated failed connections
- Encrypted vs unencrypted traffic analysis

---

## Core Features

- Load and analyze PCAP files
- Identify suspicious ports and services
- Detect potential DNS tunneling patterns
- Flag unusual traffic volumes
- Analyze session duration and frequency
- Generate structured security reports (JSON)

---

## Why This Project Exists

Packet analysis is one of the most fundamental skills in cybersecurity.
This tool demonstrates how analysts reason about traffic **without relying only on GUI tools**.

---

## Intended Audience

- SOC Analysts
- Blue Team Engineers
- Network Security Engineers
- Cybersecurity learners

---

## Disclaimer

This tool does not perform attacks or exploitation.
It is designed for defensive analysis and learning only.
